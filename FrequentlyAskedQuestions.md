### Q: iRTVO crashed, how to report? ###
A: First go to Windows' Event viewer (hit **winkey+r** and type **eventvwr**). From Event viewer browse to **Windows Logs/Application** and you should see errors at the top. When crashing iRTVO created two errors, first one is **.NET Runtime error** and the other is application error. .NET runtime error is the more interesting one, select that and copy-n-paste everything from the textbox to [iRTVO thread](http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/1351217.page)
